# Belly_Button
## Overview
The main purpose of this project is to creat an interactive dashboard using JavaScript,Plotly,and D3.js.The Dash board contain a drop menu, demographic information, and vizualization of the bacteriala data for each volunteer in three different charts.The volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

### Results
First create a horizontal bar chart using JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js. The main purpose of the chart is to display the top Ten bacterial species(OTUs)when an individual's ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.**sample_values** will be displayed in the as values. The **otu_ids** as labels,and **otu_labels** will be displayed as hover for the bars on the chart.
