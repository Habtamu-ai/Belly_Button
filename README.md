## Overview
The main purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js.The Dashboard contains a drop menu, demographic information, and visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer in three different charts.

The main purpose of the chart is to display the top Ten bacterial species(OTUs) when an individual's ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.**sample_values** will be displayed in the as values. The **otu_ids** as labels and **otu_labels** will be displayed as hover for the bars on the chart.
